# Voting Server

In an effort to always be learning, I am seeking to improve my skills with JavaScript (including ES6), React, and Redux. I am also learning volumes about how to test my JavaScript using Mocha and Chai.

I have found what appears to be the most complete and helpful tutorial I have ever seen on these libraries  [here](http://teropa.info/blog/2015/09/10/full-stack-redux-tutorial.html).

This project contains the server half of the application from this tutorial.

## To run this project:

Download both the voting client and the voting server repositories.
Open both repositories in your terminal.
Run `npm install`.
Run `npm start` on both repositories.
Open one browser window to `localhost:8080/#/results` - This will be the screen that the voting results are displayed on, it is also has the "Next" button that advances the vote on all other windows.
Open any number of other browser windows to `localhost:8080` - This is where you will actually vote.

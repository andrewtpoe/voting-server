# Voting Server

In an effort to always be learning, I am seeking to improve my skills with JavaScript (including ES6), React, and Redux. I am also learning volumes about how to test my JavaScript using Mocha and Chai.

I have found what appears to be the most complete and helpful tutorial I have ever seen on these libraries  [here](http://teropa.info/blog/2015/09/10/full-stack-redux-tutorial.html).

This project contains the server half of the application from this tutorial.

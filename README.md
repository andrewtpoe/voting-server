# Voting Server

In an effort to always be learning, I am seeking to improve my skills with JavaScript (including ES6), React, and Redux. I am also trying to learn how to test my JavaScript, a skill set I am sorely lacking in.

I have found what appears to be the most complete and helpful tutorial I have ever seen [here](http://teropa.info/blog/2015/09/10/full-stack-redux-tutorial.html)

This project is at least the server half of the application from this tutorial. I'm not certain how he splits the project later on.
